# Community Solutions Repository

This repository is a collection of solutions, snippets, and tools created to solve common problems across different platforms and technologies.  
It is not a single project but rather a **toolbox of practical examples** that others can reference, adapt, or learn from.

### What you'll find here
- Power Platform apps, flows, expressions, and custom connectors  
- Azure Functions and automation scripts  
- CRM integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot, and others)  
- SharePoint and Office 365 solutions  
- General development utilities and process automation examples  

Each folder contains its own examples with code, notes, or scripts. Some are minimal snippets, while others may be more complete solutions.  
Use these as references, adapt them to your needs, and feel free to learn from or extend them.

> ⚡ This is a **living collection**: expect a mix of quick fixes, experiments, and reusable patterns rather than polished, production-ready apps.
